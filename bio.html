<h2>Brief Bio</h2>

<div id="body">
<p>Francesco was born in Padova in 1976. He received his D.Eng. degree (highest honors) from the
University of Padova (Italy) in 2002. During the year 2002 he was a member of the UCLA
Vision Lab as a visiting student under the supervision of Prof. Stefano Soatto,
University of California Los Angeles. During this collaboration period he started a
research activity in the field of computational vision and human motion tracking. In
2003 Francesco Nori started his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Ruggero Frezza at
the University of Padova, Italy. During this period the main topic of his research
activity was modular control with special attention on biologically inspired control
structures. Francesco Nori received his Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems from
the University of Padova (Italy) in 2005. In the year 2006 he moved to the University
of Genova and started his PostDoc at the laboratory for integrated advanced robotics
(LiraLab), beginning a fruitful collaboration with Prof. Giorgio Metta and Prof.
Giulio Sandini. In 2007 Francesco Nori has moved to the Italian Institute of
technology where he is currently hired as a Tenure Track Researcher. His research
interests are currently focused on whole-body motion control exploiting multiple 
(possibly compliant) contacts. With Giorgio Metta and Lorenzo Natale he is one 
of the key researchers involved in the iCub development, with specific focus on 
control and whole-body force regulation. Francesco is currently coordinating 
the H2020-EU project An.Dy (id. 731540); in the past he has been involved in two 
FP7-EU projects: CoDyCo as coordinator and Koroibot as principal investigator.
