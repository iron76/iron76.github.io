<h2>Francesco's research interests</h2>
<p> Francesco Nori leads the the <a href="https://www.iit.it/lines/dynamic-interaction-control">
	Dynamic Interaction Control </a> research line at the <a href="https://www.iit.it">Italian 
    Institute of Technology</a>. With Giorgio Metta, Lorenzo Natale and Giulio Sandini Francesco
	is one of the main contributors to the <a href="http://www.icub.org">
    iCub </a> project.  The dynamic interaction group activities aim at endowing humanoids
	with <strong>advanced action and physical interaction capabilities</strong>. 
</p>

<p> Our research is guided by two
	underpinning principles: (1) studies on human motor control are relevant for building better performing robots;
	(2) implementing humanoids contributes to better understanding the human motor control system.
	Two different tools are at the basis of our research activities. On the one hand, iCub is 
	the technological tool, which we contribute to develop. On the other hand, <strong>control theory
	is the theoretical toolset</strong>, which scientifically grounds the technological implementations.
</p>

<p> In the attempt to combine theoretical and technological development, our research activity 
	produces sound theoretical results validated with dependable implementations on real robots. 
	<strong>The main outcomes of our research activity are control principles, algorithms, technologies 
	and implementations for compliant robot action and interaction</strong>. Our background is in engineering
	with strong competencies in physics, mathematics and computer science.

<h2>Brief biography</h2>
<p>Francesco Nori was born in Padova in 1976. He received his D.Eng. degree (highest honors) from the
University of Padova (Italy) in 2002. During the year 2002 he was a member of the UCLA
Vision Lab as a visiting student under the supervision of Prof. Stefano Soatto,
University of California Los Angeles. During this collaboration period he started a
research activity in the field of computational vision and human motion tracking. In
2003 Francesco Nori started his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Ruggero Frezza at
the University of Padova, Italy. During this period the main topic of his research
activity was modular control with special attention on biologically inspired control
structures. Francesco Nori received his Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems from
the University of Padova (Italy) in 2005. In the year 2006 he moved to the University
of Genova and started his PostDoc at the laboratory for integrated advanced robotics
(LiraLab), beginning a fruitful collaboration with Prof. Giorgio Metta and Prof.
Giulio Sandini. In 2007 Francesco Nori has moved to the Italian Institute of
technology where he is currently hired as a Tenure Track Researcher. His research
interests are currently focused on whole-body motion control exploiting multiple 
(possibly compliant) contacts. With Giorgio Metta and Lorenzo Natale he is one 
of the key researchers involved in the iCub development, with specific focus on 
control and whole-body force regulation. Francesco is currently involved in two 
FP7-EU projects: CoDyCo as coordinator and Koroibot as principal investigator. 
In the past he has been investigator in ITALK, VIACTORS and Robotcub.</p>
