## Brief biography

Francesco was born in Padova in 1976. He received his D.Eng. degree (highest honours) from the University of Padova
(Italy) in 2002. During the year 2002 he was a member of the UCLA Vision Lab as a visiting student under the
supervision of Prof. Stefano Soatto, University of California Los Angeles. During this collaboration period he
started a research activity in the field of computational vision and human motion tracking. In 2003 Francesco Nori
started his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Ruggero Frezza at the University of Padova, Italy. During this
period the main topic of his research activity was modular control with special attention on biologically inspired
control structures. Francesco Nori received his Ph.D. in Control and Dynamical Systems from the University of
Padova (Italy) in 2005. In the year 2006 he moved to the University of Genova and started his PostDoc at the
laboratory for integrated advanced robotics (LiraLab), beginning a fruitful collaboration with Prof. Giorgio Metta
and Prof. Giulio Sandini. In 2007 Francesco Nori has moved to the Italian Institute of technology where in 2015 he
was appointed Tenure Track Researcher of the Dynamic and Interaction Control research line. His research interests
are currently focused on whole-body motion control exploiting multiple (possibly compliant) contacts. With Giorgio
Metta and Lorenzo Natale he is one of the key researchers involved in the iCub development, with specific focus on
control and whole-body force regulation exploiting tactile information. Francesco is currently coordinating the
H2020-EU project An.Dy (id. 731540); in the past he has been involved in two FP7-EU projects: CoDyCo as
coordinator and Koroibot as principal investigator. In 2017 Francesco joined Deepmind where he is collaborating
with Martin Riedmiller, Jonas Buchli and Dan Belov. His current interests seamlessly span robotics and
reinforcement learning, with applications in both manipulation and locomotion.

## Research Statement

As opposed to traditional robotic applications that demanded for limited interaction and mobility, robots of the
next generations will be required to coordinate physical interaction with physical mobility. Interaction always
involve two components: the â€œselfâ€ (i.e. the robot) and the â€œotherâ€ (i.e. the interacting agent).
Successful and energetically efficient interaction necessarily passes through modelling, estimating and
controlling the mutual interaction between the self and the other. In a crescendo of complexity, research is
expected to cope with increasingly complicated scenarios. On the one hand, robots (the self) are foreseen to
become elastic and compliant. On the other hand, physical interaction is likely to occur not only with rigid and
compliant environments but also, on the long run, with humans. Gradually, robots will require advanced decisional
autonomy, adaptability and the ability to understand the intention of â€œothersâ€. To cope with scenarios and
embodiments of increasing complexity, my research activities pursue the methodology described above with focus on
three main areas: modelling, compliance and control. The final goal of these activities is to endow humanoids with
advanced action and interaction capabilities. This goal is pursued with concurrent advances along two different
but intertwined directions: on the one hand by advancing the theoretical understanding of the underlying
scientific problems; on the other hand by a continuous optimisation and redesign of the existing hardware and
software based on sound and solid theoretical bases.
